### Implementation
- [benchmark_script.py](benchmark_script.py) - Script for benchmarking Newspaper4k performance across different news sources

## Key Findings

1. **Library Capabilities**: Newspaper4k provides effective article extraction for standard news sites but has limitations with JavaScript-heavy sites and paywalled content.

2. **Performance Optimization**: Domain-specific configuration and multi-level parallelization can yield 3-5x performance improvements.

3. **Error Handling**: Implementing comprehensive retry mechanisms with exponential backoff and circuit breakers significantly improves reliability.

4. **Rate Limiting**: Enhanced robots.txt compliance and adaptive rate limiting are essential for ethical and sustainable web scraping.

5. **Configuration Management**: Different news source types require tailored configurations for optimal performance.

## Recommendations

1. Implement the enhanced Newspaper4k wrapper with improved error handling and rate limiting
2. Develop a multi-strategy scraper factory to handle different website types
3. Create a comprehensive monitoring system for performance tracking
4. Implement domain-specific configuration management
5. Integrate with alternative scraping methods for JavaScript-heavy sites

## Next Steps

The findings from this research will inform the implementation of the web scraping component of the NewsCrawler system and provide a foundation for the subsequent phases of the project, particularly the PostgreSQL database integration and LangChain vector processing components.
