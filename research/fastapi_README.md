# FastAPI Implementation Research Scripts

This directory contains research scripts for analyzing, testing, and optimizing the FastAPI implementation in the NewsCrawler project.

## Overview

These scripts are part of Phase 4 of the research plan outlined in `AI_WORKSPACE/PLANS/2025-03-10_Newspaper4k_PostgreSQL_LangChain_Pipeline_Research.md`. They are designed to evaluate different aspects of the API, from endpoint design to performance and scalability.

## Prerequisites

Before running these scripts, make sure you have:

1. Set up the PostgreSQL database with pgvector extension
2. Installed all required dependencies from `requirements.txt`
3. Created a `.env` file with necessary environment variables (see `.env.example`)
4. Started the FastAPI application using `uvicorn src.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`

## Scripts

### FastAPI Analysis

#### `fastapi_analysis.py`

Analyzes the current FastAPI implementation, focusing on:
- Endpoint design and RESTful practices
- API documentation quality
- Error handling and validation
- Authentication and rate limiting

**Usage:**
```bash
python research/fastapi_analysis.py
```

**Output:**
- `research/results/endpoint_analysis.csv`: Analysis of API endpoints
- `research/results/restful_analysis.json`: Analysis of RESTful practices
- `research/results/documentation_analysis.json`: Analysis of API documentation
- `research/results/error_handling_analysis.csv`: Analysis of error handling
- `research/results/error_handling_metrics.json`: Metrics for error handling

### API Performance Testing

#### `api_performance_testing.py`

Tests the performance and scalability of the FastAPI application:
- Measures response times under various load conditions
- Tests concurrent request handling
- Evaluates API throughput and latency
- Identifies bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

**Usage:**
```bash
python research/api_performance_testing.py
```

**Output:**
- `research/results/api_performance_detailed.csv`: Detailed performance results
- `research/results/api_performance_summary.csv`: Summary of performance results
- `research/results/api_scalability_results.csv`: Scalability test results
- `research/results/response_time_by_endpoint.png`: Visualization of response times
- `research/results/throughput_by_endpoint.png`: Visualization of throughput
- `research/results/success_rate_by_endpoint.png`: Visualization of success rates
- `research/results/response_time_vs_concurrency.png`: Response time vs. concurrency
- `research/results/throughput_vs_concurrency.png`: Throughput vs. concurrency
- `research/results/success_rate_vs_concurrency.png`: Success rate vs. concurrency

### RAG API Implementation

#### `rag_api_implementation.py`

Implements and tests additional RAG endpoints for the FastAPI application:
- Implements a RAG router with endpoints for question answering and document retrieval
- Tests the performance and quality of the RAG endpoints
- Evaluates different configurations for the RAG pipeline
- Provides recommendations for production deployment

**Usage:**
```bash
python research/rag_api_implementation.py
```

**Output:**
- `research/results/rag_router.py`: Implementation of the RAG router
- `research/results/main_py_update.txt`: Instructions for updating main.py
- `research/results/rag_question_results.csv`: Results of question answering tests
- `research/results/rag_retrieval_results.csv`: Results of document retrieval tests
- `research/results/rag_question_summary.csv`: Summary of question answering performance
- `research/results/rag_retrieval_summary.csv`: Summary of document retrieval performance

## Results Directory

All analysis and test results are saved to the `research/results/` directory. This directory is created automatically if it doesn't exist.

## Environment Variables

The scripts require the following environment variables:

```
# API configuration
API_HOST=localhost
API_PORT=8000

# Database connection
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://newscrawler:newscrawler_password@localhost:5432/newscrawler

# GroqAI API
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```

## Key Findings

Based on our research, we recommend:

1. **Endpoint Design**: Follow RESTful practices with resource-oriented endpoints and appropriate HTTP methods
2. **Performance Optimization**: Use async endpoints and connection pooling for improved concurrency handling
3. **Caching Strategy**: Implement response caching for search and retrieval endpoints to reduce response times
4. **Error Handling**: Provide structured error responses with appropriate status codes and error messages
5. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive API documentation with detailed endpoint descriptions and examples
6. **RAG Endpoints**: Use hybrid search for document retrieval and enhanced prompting for question answering
7. **Scalability**: Monitor response times and implement horizontal scaling when concurrency exceeds 30 requests

## Next Steps

After completing the FastAPI implementation research, the next phases will focus on:

1. Docker containerization research
2. End-to-end pipeline testing
3. Documentation and knowledge transfer

## Implementation Recommendations

To implement the RAG endpoints in the production API:

1. Copy the `rag_router.py` file to `src/api/routers/rag.py`
2. Update `src/api/main.py` according to the instructions in `main_py_update.txt`
3. Restart the API server

For optimal performance:

1. Configure connection pooling in the database session
2. Implement response caching for search and retrieval endpoints
3. Use async endpoints for improved concurrency handling
4. Monitor response times and scale horizontally when needed
