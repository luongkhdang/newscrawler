## Project Overview
NewsCrawler is a comprehensive system designed to collect, process, store, and retrieve news articles from various sources. The system employs web scraping techniques to gather articles, processes them using natural language processing, stores them in a structured database, and provides a RESTful API for accessing the data. Additionally, the system includes a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) component that enhances large language model capabilities with the collected news data.

## Project Priorities and Constraints

### Key Priorities:
1. **Performance Optimization**: The system is designed to be fully optimized for speed and performance, with this being the primary consideration in all architectural decisions.
2. **Research Focus**: As this project is for research purposes, it prioritizes data collection completeness and processing capabilities over commercial considerations.
3. **Single-User Design**: The system is designed for personal use by the developer, not as a multi-user application.

### Deprioritized Concerns:
1. **User Authentication/Authorization**: Since the application is for personal research use only, complex user management systems are unnecessary.
2. **Abuse Prevention**: As a single-user research tool, protection against API abuse or malicious usage is not a primary concern.
3. **Ethical Scraping Limitations**: While basic politeness protocols are maintained to avoid overloading target sites, certain ethical constraints on data collection may be relaxed for research purposes.
4. **Compliance Requirements**: As a personal research tool, certain compliance requirements that would apply to commercial applications are not applicable.

### Optimization Focus Areas:
- Maximum throughput for web scraping operations
- Minimal latency for vector search and retrieval operations
- Efficient resource utilization for embedding generation and LLM inference
- Optimized storage and retrieval patterns for large-scale article collection

## Project Scope

### Included:
- Development of a robust web scraping system using multiple libraries (Newspaper4k, feedparser, gnews, BeautifulSoup4, Puppeteer)
- Processing and cleaning of article content to extract relevant information

### Excluded:
- Development of the actual RAG chatbot interface (future project)
- Real-time news alerting or notification systems
- Sentiment analysis or advanced NLP processing of articles (may be added in future iterations)
- User authentication and authorization systems (unless required for API access)
- **Image scraping and storage**: The system should NEVER scrape, process, or store images from articles to optimize performance, reduce bandwidth usage, and avoid potential copyright issues

### Development Guidelines

#### Virtual Environment Setup
All Python development for this project MUST use virtual environments (venv) instead of global environments. This ensures dependency isolation, reproducibility, and prevents conflicts between packages.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment in the project directory
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies within the virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt

# When finished, deactivate the virtual environment
deactivate
```

#### Virtual Environment Best Practices
1. Never install packages globally for this project
2. Always activate the virtual environment before working on the project
3. Keep requirements.txt updated with all dependencies
4. Include venv/ in .gitignore to avoid committing the virtual environment
5. Document any new dependencies added to the project

## Research Phases

4. **Investment Trends and Economic Indicators**: Global and regional economic data and analysis
5. **Currency Interactions**: Tracking USD, USD-EURO, USD-VND, USD-YEN, USD-YUAN exchange rates and related news
6. **Market Indices**: Monitoring S&P 500, DJIA, QQQ performance and related news
7. **Research Papers and Official Statistics**: Aggregation of academic and governmental data sources

### Data Source APIs

The system integrates with multiple specialized APIs to ensure comprehensive coverage:

1. **MediaCloud API**: Primary source for general news articles from yesterday to today
   - Cross-platform news search with collection/source/feed directory browsing
   - Implements story list search with focused topic keywords
   - Filters by collections relevant to countries of interest

2. **NewsAPI**: Direct news source with 24-hour delay
