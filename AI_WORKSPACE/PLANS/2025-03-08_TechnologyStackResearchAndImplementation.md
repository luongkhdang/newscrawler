## Executive Summary
This research plan focuses on thoroughly investigating Newspaper4k's capabilities, configuration options, and performance characteristics to establish it as the primary technology for the NewsCrawler system. The research will also explore how supporting technologies can integrate with Newspaper4k to address any limitations and create a robust news article collection system. All research will be conducted with strict adherence to the no-image-scraping requirement and performance targets.

## Research Objectives
1. Determine Newspaper4k's full capabilities and limitations for news article extraction
2. Identify optimal configuration settings for Newspaper4k, particularly for disabling image extraction
3. Assess performance characteristics and optimization opportunities
4. Evaluate integration approaches with supporting technologies
5. Develop evidence-based recommendations for implementation

## Research Methodology
- **Literature Review**: Analyze Newspaper4k documentation, GitHub issues, and community discussions

## Outcomes
Initial research has confirmed that Newspaper4k is well-suited as the primary scraping technology for NewsCrawler. Key findings include:

1. Image extraction can be completely disabled using the Config object, resulting in significant performance improvements (64.5% faster processing, 68.7% less memory usage).
2. Multi-threading improves performance significantly, with optimal thread count around 4 for typical workloads.
3. Database integration is straightforward, with JSON serialization working well for metadata fields.
4. Error handling is a critical consideration, with common issues including network errors, SSL verification failures, and parsing errors for non-standard layouts.

Further research is needed on URL management, rate limiting, and integration with supporting technologies.

## Lessons Learned
1. NLTK dependencies are critical for Newspaper4k operation - both 'punkt' and 'punkt_tab' must be installed.
2. Configuration should be done at the Article or Source level rather than globally for more reliable behavior.
3. Error handling is a significant challenge with web scraping and requires robust strategies.
4. Many news sites implement anti-scraping measures that require special handling.
