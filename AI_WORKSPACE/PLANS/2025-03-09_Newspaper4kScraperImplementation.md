**Objective**: Develop a robust multi-strategy scraper system with Newspaper4k as the primary component, capable of efficiently handling 3,700+ URLs with appropriate error handling, rate limiting, and standardized output format.
**Estimated Completion**: 2 weeks

## Executive Summary
This plan outlines the implementation of a scalable multi-strategy scraper system for NewsCrawler, with Newspaper4k as the primary component. Given the large dataset of 3,700 URLs, we'll implement a classification system to route URLs to the most appropriate scraper strategy, along with batch processing, parallel execution, and comprehensive monitoring. The implementation will follow a modular design with clear interfaces for integration with the broader system and will include testing across diverse news sources.

## Key Requirements
- **No Image Scraping**: The system should NEVER scrape, process, or store images from articles. This is a strict requirement to optimize performance, reduce bandwidth usage, and avoid potential copyright issues. All scraper implementations must be configured to explicitly disable image extraction by default.

## Current Focus
We have successfully implemented the core infrastructure components including the URL classification system, batch processing infrastructure, and the Newspaper4k-based scraper. The next focus is on implementing the RSS/Feed-based scraper, which will be more efficient for sites that provide RSS feeds.

## Current Issues and Fixes

During the implementation and testing of the GUI application, we've identified several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Feed Scraper Implementation**
   - **Issue**: The `FeedScraper` class is being treated as an abstract class with unimplemented abstract methods.
   - **Fix**: Ensure the `FeedScraper` class implements all required methods from the `BaseScraper` interface.

2. **ArticleMetadata Constructor Parameters**
   - **Issue**: There are mismatches between the parameters we're using to create `ArticleMetadata` objects and what the constructor expects.
   - **Fix**: Update the parameter names in the `FeedScraper._extract_article_from_entry` method to match the `ArticleMetadata` constructor.

3. **NLTK Data Missing**
   - **Issue**: The application is showing warnings about missing NLTK data, specifically the `punkt_tab` resource.
   - **Fix**: Create a utility script to download required NLTK data packages during application initialization.

4. **Unicode Encoding Errors**
   - **Issue**: There are logging errors related to Unicode encoding in the console.
   - **Fix**: Update the logging configuration to handle Unicode characters properly.

5. **Logger References**
   - **Issue**: There are inconsistencies in how loggers are referenced in the `ScraperFactory` class.
   - **Fix**: Standardize logger usage across all classes.

6. **Thread-Safety in URL Classifier**
   - **Issue**: SQLite connections are not thread-safe, causing errors when used across different threads.
   - **Fix**: Implement thread-local storage for SQLite connections in the `URLClassifier` class.

7. **Image Scraping Not Required**
   - **Note**: The project does not require scraping images from articles. We can optimize the scrapers to skip image extraction, which will improve performance and reduce bandwidth usage.
   - **Implementation**: Update the scrapers to make image extraction disabled by default. Ensure this is consistently applied across all scraper implementations.

```

## Testing Strategy

To effectively test the scraper system with 3,700 URLs, we'll implement a multi-phase testing approach:

1. **Domain Categorization**:
   - Group URLs by domain (likely 100-200 unique domains)
   - Sample 3-5 URLs from each domain for initial testing
   - Categorize domains by structure and complexity

2. **Representative Sampling**:
   - Create a test set with ~300 URLs (5-10% of total)
   - Ensure representation from each domain category
   - Include known challenging cases

3. **Strategy Effectiveness Testing**:
   - Test each URL with multiple scraper strategies
   - Compare extraction quality and success rates
   - Document optimal strategy for each domain type

4. **Scalability Testing**:
   - Test with increasing batch sizes (10, 100, 500, 1000)
   - Measure throughput, memory usage, and CPU utilization
   - Determine optimal batch size and parallelization
   - Compare performance with image extraction disabled

5. **Long-running Stability Test**:
   - Run continuous scraping of the full dataset
   - Monitor for memory leaks or performance degradation
   - Test recovery from failures

## Performance Optimization

To handle 3,700 URLs efficiently, we'll implement several optimization strategies:

1. **Domain-aware Parallelization**:
   - Group URLs by domain for batch processing
   - Apply domain-specific rate limits
   - Process different domains in parallel

2. **Resource Management**:
   - Implement connection pooling to reduce overhead
   - Add memory usage monitoring and garbage collection
   - Create CPU usage throttling to prevent overload

3. **Caching**:
   - Cache robots.txt responses with appropriate TTL
   - Implement HTML content caching for retry scenarios
   - Create metadata caching for repeated extractions

4. **Adaptive Rate Limiting**:
   - Start with conservative rate limits
   - Gradually increase based on successful responses
   - Back off quickly on errors or slow responses

5. **Image Extraction Disabling**:
   - Ensure all scrapers have image extraction disabled by default
   - Measure and document performance improvements from this optimization
