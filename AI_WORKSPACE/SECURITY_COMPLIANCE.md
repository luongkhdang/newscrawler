- Implement alerts for unauthorized access attempts
- Maintain audit trails for compliance

### Principle of Least Privilege
- Assign minimal necessary permissions to each role
- Regularly review and update role permissions
- Implement time-limited elevated privileges
- Use separate service accounts for automated processes
- Implement proper separation of duties
